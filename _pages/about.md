I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majoring in artificial intelligence. Also, I am from Young Gifted Honor Program at XJTU and have graduated within the top 30% among 115 people. I spent a semester as an exchange student at the University of California, Berkeley. I will complete my bachelor's degree in July of 2024, and I am enthusiastic about pursuing further studies in artificial intelligence. My research interest is Computer Vision, especially video generation. I hope to solve the flickering problem between adjacent frames.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a passion for various forms of art and culture. I like photography, music(especially Cantopop and Chinese Indie), movies and literature. My favorite singers and bands include Anpu, Juno Mak, and my little airport. In the realm of film, directors such as Ingmar Bergman, Luis Buñuel, and Wong Kar Wai captivate me, while writers like Hermann Hesse, Mishima Yuki, and Virginia Woolf inspire my literary interests.

I am eager to communicate with you if you are willing to.
